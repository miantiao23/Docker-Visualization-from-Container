Here are some experiences I have these days with the docker container. I was trying to use a container to visualize the apps from the docker containers. 
However, it did not work. I made it happen before. I checked all my history before, and I just have some docker commands left. Therefore, I got stuck for 
the commands for a long while until today.

Here is the old docker command I left beforeï¼š 
```
        docker run -it --gpus all -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -e DISPLAY=unix$DISPLAY ubuntu/cuda:torch1
```
```
$ npm install --save @github/clipboard-copy-element
```
